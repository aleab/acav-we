"Would it be possible to add a delay setting without much effort? My system sound is connected to the speakers via bluetooth and has a slight delay (~ 0.5 seconds). If you could add an option to set an individual delay for the "movement" of the visuals so one can manually fix the offset it would be perfect! Nevertheless thanks for the great wallpaper! Beside my individual delay-"problem" it works perfectly :)"

"I wanted to ask: is there a possibility you will expand the thresholds for movement on the Visualizer? Oftentimes I want one of the circular ones to scale smaller than the app allows, or the ability to rotate or move the linear ones left/right."
